# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Version

### v1.0

Well, I created this react a few months ago and I finally git push this into this repository. yay \o/

Known Issues: 
- Everything is working fine, except one (major) issue. In Home.js, state.results[0] in line 29 will throw an error first before the API is even called and the application will throw an error instead of calling an API.
- One temporary fix is comment out all the return statement in Home.js so the API can be called first, then you de-comment them.

(React Project on hold due to annoying bug related to async API issues. My computer is too fast maybe)
